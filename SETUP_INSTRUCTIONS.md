## To Connect Real Database

1. **Set up Supabase Project**:
   - Go to https://supabase.com
   - Create a new project
   - Go to Settings > API to get your credentials

2. **Update Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_actual_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_actual_anon_key
   ```

3. **Run Database Schema**:
   - Copy the SQL from `/database-schema.sql`
   - Run it in your Supabase SQL editor
   - This will create the `Lending1` schema with all tables

4. **Restart Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
